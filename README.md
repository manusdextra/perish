# Static Site Generator

I made this tool as a learning exercise in various things. In the beginning, I went for a simple shell script, since that was what interested me at the time. I also thought it might be easier to have immediate access to files through I/O redirection built into the shell. When my ideas became more complex, I decided to re-write the script in Python, which also meant I could learn a lot about _pathlib_ in the process.

Another reason for going with Python is the _re_ library. When writing the shell script, I thought about using something like _sed_ or _awk_ to convert my articles from Markdown, but it seemed overkill to learn an entire new language just for this "simple" task. I previously refactored a markdown parser as part of an online programming exercise, and this made me curious about regular expressions, and I thought it would be easier to learn them within a familiar environment. I have now started to extract the parser I wrote into a separate file, and I may develop it further (or replace it with a pre-built solution if I find that it doesn't suit my needs anymore).

Finally, I had been reading about lightweight, minimalistic web design, and the idea appealed to me, so I wanted to use this opportunity to write a simple site using only barebones HTML and CSS. I figure it might also be a good testing ground for various accessibility optimizations and best practices I read about online.
